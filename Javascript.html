  <h2>Javascript</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank"
    title="html5 specification">JavaScript</a> often abbreviated as JS,
    is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7]
    JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
    It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
    object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br><br>
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
    of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages
    and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of
    websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web
    browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
